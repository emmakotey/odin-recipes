    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Katsu, a popular Japanese comfort food of breaded cutlets, is commonly made with chicken or pork. 
        For this chicken version, boneless chicken breasts are pounded thin, dredged in flour, egg and panko,
        then fried until golden brown for an irresistible crispy crust that yields to — and protects — juicy 
        meat inside. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        The traditional accompaniments are a mound of crunchy shredded cabbage, steamed rice and a generous 
        drizzle of sweet-savory katsu sauce. Also called tonkatsu sauce, it’s a tangy Japanese-style barbecue 
        sauce made with soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, tomatoes, ginger and clove. Though you can purchase 
        bottles of it in Asian markets or online, the sauce is easy to make, lasts indefinitely in the fridge 
        and serves as a great all-purpose dip.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any 
            excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and 
            fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
